        <h2> Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
        Outside of school I enjoy working out, listening to music, art, yoga, and hanging out with my friends. I enjoy going out with my friends on the weekends, but I also love going on walks, cooking dinner, and having movie nights. I am very outgoing and played basketball all my life leading up to college, along with track and lifting daily. I am currently reading a book called Fierce Conversations, which I have found helpful for my major.
        I am from Tacoma, Washington and moved to Billings, Montana when I entered middle school. I have lived in Montana for about 10 years now and have a love-hate relationship with it. I think that living in Montana has made me very appreciative for my experiences here at Syracuse.
